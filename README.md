# Playtime Limiter

PlaytimeLimiter is a simple Spigot plugin, made for MC version 1.21.5, written in Java 24, and built and compiled using Maven. 

PlaytimeLimiter uses YAML files specific to each player to track individual playtime. As of snapshot 1.0, there is no implementation of changing playtime values, only core functionality of storing and retreiving player data and plugin config.


## Deployment

To deploy this project in your own environment...   would be no small feat. If you're interested in building, compiling, or contributing to this project, please feel free to create a branch and pull requests, but I cannot offer guidance on how to at this time. I hope to add more information as I develop this project further. 

## Documentation

[Just Kidding!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

While I don't have an official documentation page for this project yet, I will eventually! For now, the source codebase is small, incomplex, and self-explanatory with the help of the Spigot Java docs. If you have any questions about usage or configuration, please send in a comment, I'll make sure to answer it when I can. While bug reports are welcome, they will not be acknowledged unless submitted after the first official release of the plugin.
